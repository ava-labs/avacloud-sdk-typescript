  description: `Get Interchain Message (ICM) rolling window metrics

Interchain Message (ICM) rolling window metrics are available for all  Avalanche L1s on _Mainnet_ and _Fuji_ (testnet). You can request metrics  by source and/or destination blockchainId or by network. Rolling window metrics are available for the last hour, day, month,  90 days,year, and all time.

### Metrics

<ins>ICMSrcDestRollingWindowMsgCount</ins>: The number of ICM  messages sent from the source blockchain to the destination blockchain within the last hour, day, month, year, and all time.

<ins>ICMSrcRollingWindowMsgCount</ins>: The number of ICM  messages sent from the source blockchain to each destination blockchain within the last hour, day, month, 90 days, year, and all time.

<ins>ICMSrcRollingWindowAggMsgCount</ins>: The number of ICM  messages sent from the source blockchain to all destination blockchain within the last hour, day, month, 90 days, year, and all time.

<ins>ICMDestRollingWindowMsgCount</ins>: The number of ICM  messages received from any blockchain to each destination blockchain within the last hour, day, month, 90 days, year, and all time.

<ins>ICMDestRollingWindowAggMsgCount</ins>: The number of ICM  messages received from any blockchain to all destination blockchain within the last hour, day, month, 90 days, year, and all time.

<ins>ICMNetworkRollingWindowMsgCount</ins>: The number of ICM  messages sent from any blockchain to each destination blockchain within the last hour, day, month, 90 days, year, and all time.

<ins>ICMNetworkRollingWindowAggMsgCount</ins>: The number of ICM  messages sent from any blockchain to all destination blockchain within the last hour, day, month, 90 days, year, and all time.`,
